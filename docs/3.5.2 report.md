# 3.5.2 Task 2: Coverage improvement (getImageInfo)

## Overview
Our team split the work across members. This report covers my part: improving branch coverage for  
`PngImageParser#getImageInfo(ByteSource, PngImagingParameters)`.

## Before
Before writing new tests, the JaCoCo report showed weaker branch coverage for `getImageInfo` compared to some lower-complexity methods in the same class.  
Evidence: [Before screenshot](assets/GII_evidence_before.png)

## What I did
1. Added manual branch instrumentation (IDs like `GII_*`) inside `getImageInfo` to count how often each branch executes.
2. Wrote new unit tests to trigger previously untested paths, focusing on:
   - exceptions and early exits (e.g., missing/duplicate critical chunks),
   - optional chunk presence/absence (e.g., `tRNS`, `pHYs`, `sCAL`, `PLTE`),
   - switch cases for color type (grayscale vs RGB families).

## Result (after adding new tests)
After adding the new tests, JaCoCo reports a clear improvement in branch coverage for `getImageInfo`.  
Evidence: [After screenshot](assets/GII_evidence_after.png)

My manual coverage report also shows many more branch IDs being hit, which confirms the tests are exercising the intended decision points (not just increasing line coverage).

## Notes / unreachable branches
Some branches may be effectively unreachable in normal execution due to validation earlier in the parsing pipeline (defensive code paths). For example, the `default` branch in the color-type switch (`GII_SW_DEFAULT`) is defensive and may not be triggerable with well-formed objects because invalid color types are rejected earlier.

# Questions 

## Q1: What is the quality of your own coverage measurement? Does it take into account ternary operators and exceptions?
My manual coverage counts are **explicit**: a branch is marked only when execution reaches the corresponding `hit("ID")` call. This captures normal `if/else` branches and **exceptions** when I place a hit directly before `throw`. For ternary operators (`cond ? a : b`), it is **only counted if I explicitly instrument both outcomes** (otherwise it is invisible to the manual tool).

## Q2: What are the limitations of your tool? How would instrumentation change if you modify the program?
The tool is **manual and intrusive**: it requires editing production code and keeping IDs synchronized with the logic. If the code changes (new conditions, refactors, reordered branches), the instrumentation must be updated and IDs may need to be added/removed to remain accurate. It also does not automatically understand complex boolean expressions, short-circuit behavior, or path combinations unless explicitly instrumented.

## Q3: If you have an automated tool, are your results consistent with existing tools?
Yes. The manual report is consistent with JaCoCo in the sense that after adding tests, both show improved coverage for `getImageInfo`. JaCoCo provides the authoritative automated branch coverage percentage, while the manual tool provides fine-grained confirmation of which specific decision points were exercised.

# Summary for function `readBitmapIconData`

### What are your results? Did everyone get the same result? Is there something that is unclear? If you have a tool, is its result the same as yours?


### Are the functions/methods with high CC also very long in terms of LOC?


### What is the purpose of these functions? Is it related to the high CC?



### If your programming language uses exceptions: Are they taken into account by the tool? If you think of an exception as another possible branch (to the catch block or the end of the function), how is the CC affected?


### Is the documentation of the function clear about the different possible outcomes induced by different branches taken?
